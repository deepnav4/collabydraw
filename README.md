###  **Privacy & End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)** in CollabyDraw

CollabyDraw is built with **privacy by design** to ensure that no sensitive drawing data can be accessed by anyone other than the intended participants.


###  **Key Never Touches the Server**

- The **encryption key** after the comma (`xyz456`) is part of the URL fragment (`#...`).
- This fragment is **never sent** in HTTP requests, meaning:
    
    > The server cannot see or store the encryption key.
    > 

###  **Client-Side Only Decryption**

- All encrypted drawing data is transmitted over WebSocket.
- The **decryption and rendering** happen completely on the client-side using the `key` from the URL.
- Even if someone intercepts the WebSocket traffic, they cannot decrypt the data without the key.

###  **Benefits**

- No one — not even the server — can read what’s drawn in a room without the key.
- Ensures **confidentiality** for private brainstorming, teaching, or design sessions.
- Works like **Collabydraw's E2EE rooms**, but tailored for your collaborative drawing logic.
